            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Cyno Overload, or CynOverload, is an aggro deck that aims to disrupt the opponent with powerful one-shot attacks 
                by spreading Pyro and quickly accumulating cards to have a massive threat range. Use Dehya's Molten Inferno and 
                Chevreuse's Ring of Bursting Grenades to afflict targets with Pyro, then swap to Cyno at the right moment to 
                chain back-to-back KOs!
            </p>
            <h2>Mulligan</h2>
            <p>Cyno requires many cards in hand and as much HP as possible to safely come in and begin throwing off strong attacks, 
                so cards like Liben, Strategize, and Countdown to the Show: 3 are extremely useful for allowing the player to use 
                the rest of their dice well on Round 1 without being forced to commit to attacks after Dehya's Molten Inferno. 
                Prospector's Drill is a key component in allowing Cyno to one-shot opposing characters, particularly with Tada!
                and Overcharged Balls available, so a copy should be kept if it appears in the starting hand. The White Glove 
                and the Fisherman, despite not costing dice, generates free +1 damage bonuses which allow Cyno to easily hit 
                damage breakpoints. However, it needs to be played early so that the shuffled cards can be drawn as soon as possible.

            </p>
            <h2>Early Game</h2>
            <p>
            As mentioned previously, Cyno needs Pyro on opposing characters and several cards in hand to one-shot opponents, 
            so the starting character will always be Dehya, using Molten Inferno. Her personal damage is low, 
            and her Elemental Burst is expensive, so having her soak damage is ideal rather than aiming to make use of her 
            Fiery Sanctum Field's damage reduction on Round 1. Very few decks have the resources to KO Dehya on Round 1, 
            and those that do will have much less resources to stave off Cyno when he swaps in.<br><br>

            After using Dehya's Elemental Skill, the player will have 5 dice left to use on Round 1. These should be used on 
            cards to gain resources; some combination of Liben, Prospector's Drill, Gambler's Earrings, 
            Strategize, Nature and Wisdom, 
            and Countdown to the Show: 3 can be used. The player may consider using Elemental Resonance: Woven Flames to reach a sixth 
            die, allowing for a combination of Liben + Countdown to the Show: 3, though this may leave them with less options 
            to usefully spend dice on later Rounds in order to maintain turn priority.<br><br>

            Against decks with a way to negate Pyro auras, such as decks with character cards like Sangonomiya Kokomi, 
            Barbara, and Xingqiu, Chevreuse is often the next character swapped to in order to circumvent this 
            (which can be done on Round 1). Her Elemental Burst, Ring of Bursting Grenades, generates the effect Secondary 
            Explosive Shells. It deals Pyro damage to the opponent's next active character after they perform a switch, 
            all but guaranteeing Pyro auras for Cyno to Overload with. However, her Elemental Skill is weak, and she 
            lacks an efficient way to charge a second point of Energy, so she often relies on Calx's Arts
            in order to use her Elemental Burst.<br><br>

            If the player has the right dice to go for it in lieu of ramp, the player can swap to Cyno after Dehya's 
            Elemental Skill and use his own Elemental Skill early. This does accelerate his increase in Indwelling, 
            allowing him to have 2 levels at the start of Round 2 and enables Featherfall Judgment to immediately 
            provide its +2 damage bonus. It is more effective against decks that spend all of their dice on ramp on 
            Round 1, which can allow the player to still hit an Overloaded reaction and trigger Chevreuse's Vertical 
            Force Coordination, generating an Overcharged Ball.
            </p>
            
            <h2>Mid-Game</h2>
            <p>
            Otherwise, Cyno will look for an opportunity to switch in and force an Overloaded reaction to generate an 
            Overloaded Ball at the start of Round 2. This first attack will not usually one-shot opponents, 
            but can put them at a low enough HP threshold for Cyno to KO them with a single attack later, and the 
            Overcharged Ball is nearly mandatory to enable Cyno's big hits. Overloaded Ball works best when it is Discarded, 
            as it lets the player deal Pyro damage without having to commit to an attack of their own, which 
            can be done with the effect of Prospector's Drill and Tada!. This Pyro application can also break 
            the damage reduction of efficient defense like Lotus Flower Crisp, and enable use of 
            Elemental Resonance: Fervent Flames.<br><br>

            Cyno can aim for a one-hit KO as early as this point in the game. With an opponent at 9 HP 
            with a Pyro aura applied (typically from Fiery Sanctum Field), Prospector Drill's +1 damage 
            (which can be triggered manually via Tada!) combined with Elemental Resonance: Fervent Flames' 
            +3 damage makes his Elemental Skill deal 9 damage for 3 more dice. This is significant as 
            it allows Cyno to grab a one-hit KO without requiring an Overcharged Ball in hand, and the 
            other damage bonuses have too long of a delay to them to consistently enable this on Round 2. 
            If an Overcharged Ball is in hand, this line can be repeated later in the game on 10 HP characters 
            (as Overcharged Ball will deal 1 Pyro damage upon being Discarded by Prospector's Drill).<br><br>

            After swapping to Cyno and using an attack, the player will have 4 dice leftover 
            (6 dice if Liben was triggered from Round 1 or 1 die if the player went for the one-hit KO mentioned above). 
            Swapping to another character, usually Chevreuse, is the go-to option, as she can take advantage of 
            Fiery Sanctum Field's damage reduction if it has not been triggered that Round and use Calx's Arts 
            to immediately attack with Ring of Bursting Grenades if she has not done so already.<br><br>

            Cyno can also opt for a second Elemental Skill, which is especially powerful with Featherfall Judgment 
            in hand. His Talent card will let him deal 5 damage, have 4 Indwelling levels (i.e. a +2 damage bonus 
            on all of his attacks) at the start of Round 3, and apply Electro again for a potential second 
            Overcharged Ball, before swapping to another character. Swapping off is vital as nearly all of the deck's 
            damage comes from Cyno's attacks, meaning he cannot afford to take unnecessary damage or fall unless 
            the player can ensure that Chevreuse and/or Dehya are able to finish off the game.
            </p>
            <h2>Late Game</h2>
            <p>
            At this point in the game, the player should have several, if not all of the pieces required in order 
            for Cyno to KO opponents efficiently. There are a number of ways for Cyno to do this, though all require 
            an Overloaded Reaction to occur.<br><br>

            For opponents at 8 HP with a Pyro aura applied (from Chevreuse's Elemental Skill, Elemental Burst, 
            or an extra instance of damage from either Fiery Sanctum field or Secondary Explosive Shells), 
            Elemental Resonance: Fervent Flames is all that is needed to grab a KO. Without it, one-shotting 
            opponents from this health range requires Featherfall Judgment or 4+ levels of Indwelling to be 
            available as a substitute and another +1 damage bonus (Called in for Cleanup or Prospector's Drill, 
            the latter of which can be guaranteed with Tada!).<br><br>
            
            To supplement KOs are Gambler's Earrings, which gives the player an extra 2 dice upon a KO 
            (profiting by 1 die on the first KO, and 3 dice by the second KO), Leave It to Me! to allow Cyno to 
            attack after a swap immediately, Fresh Wind of Freedom to maintain momentum and potentially 
            force back-to-back KOs, and Countdown to the Show (ideally at a cost of 2 or less) or 
            Nature and Wisdom to allow the player to search for any of the above cards. 
            After 2 uses of his Elemental Skill, Cyno will have 4 Indwelling levels by Round 3, 
            giving him a free +2 damage bonus on all his attacks. This allows him to finish off the game reliably 
            without the need for Elemental Auras.<br><br>
            
            The player should be aiming to chain the effects of Gambler's Earrings this Round with the use of the 
            above cards, and saving remaining resources for taking out the opponent's final character. 
            Lotus Flower Crisp can be used liberally here, as the deck's gameplan crumbles without Cyno on standby.                
            </p>
            <h2>Protecting Cyno</h2>
            <p>
                The deck's main defense against opposing attacks, besides using the health points of other characters to take 
                damage for Cyno, are Fiery Sanctum Field's damage reduction, Prospector Drill's damage reduction, and Lotus 
                Flower Crisp. An important nuance to note is that both Prospector Drill's damage reduction and Lotus 
                Flower Crisp's damage reduction are both Character Statuses, meaning the order in which they are depleted 
                depends entirely on which effect comes into play first.<br><br>

                If both effects are needed to defend Cyno, it is best to play Prospector's Drill first so that 1 damage 
                instances like opposing Overcharged Balls, Secondary Explosive Shells, or effects like Kuki Shinobu's 
                Grass Ring of Sanctification and Tada! do not 'waste' the extra damage reduction from Lotus Flower Crisp. 
                This is especially important in the mirror match, as the deck has very low damage output outside of Cyno, 
                meaning whichever side lets their Cyno be KOed first is almost always the loser.

            </p>
            <h2>Managing Prospector Drill's Discards</h2>
            <p>
                Prospector's Drill's damage reduction comes at the price of the highest cost Card in the player's Hand being 
                Discarded upon the holder taking damage. Ideally, the card being Discarded in this way is Overcharged Ball 
                (barring scenarios where you may want to retain the threat of immediate Pyro application). The deck is built 
                around allowing Prospector's Drill to target and Discard Overcharged Balls as much as possible, though there 
                are more expensive cards than it in the deck for good reason. These are Featherfall Judgment, which provides 
                a free +2 damage bonus for an extremely easy to meet prerequisite, Countdown to the Show: 3, which effectively 
                has its cost reduced upon being Discarded, and Prospector's Drill itself (the second copy is very rarely used).<br><br>

                Due to how efficient Featherfall Judgment is for Cyno's damage output, it may be required that the player 
                telegraph it and equip it early so that Prospector's Drill does not accidentally Discard it. Nature and Wisdom 
                can be also used to shuffle these higher cost Cards back into the deck, though the player will save more dice 
                by Tuning them in order to get Prospector's Drill to Discard the 'right' card (Overcharged Ball).<br><br>
                
                Tada! can trigger Prospector Drill's Discard effect without opponent intervention, and its confirmation screen 
                can allow the player to see whether or not Overcharged Ball will be Discarded (it will show the opponent taking 
                1 Pyro damage if this is the case). This is also the case if there is an effect like Sparks n' Splash or 
                Thunderbore Trap on Cyno's side, appearing on the confirmation screen before Cyno uses a skill. Note that 
                drawing into other 2 cost cards with effects like Strategize can cause Prospector's Drill's effect to choose 
                a different card to Discard.
