            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Cyno Overload, or <strong>CynOverload</strong>, is an aggro deck that aims to disrupt the opponent with powerful one-shot 
                attacks by spreading Pyro and quickly accumulating cards to have a massive threat range. 
                Use Dehya's Molten Inferno and Chevreuse's Ring of Bursting Grenades to afflict targets with Pyro, 
                then swap to Cyno at the right moment to chain back-to-back KOs!
            </p>
            <h2>Mulligan</h2>
            <p>Cyno requires many cards in hand and as much HP as possible to safely swap in and begin throwing off strong 
                attacks, so cards like <strong>Liben</strong>, <strong>Strategize</strong>, 
                and <strong>Countdown to the Show: 3</strong> are extremely useful and allow the player to use the rest 
                    of their dice well on Round 1 without having to commit to attacks after 
                Dehya's Molten Inferno. <strong>Prospector's Drill</strong> is a key component in allowing Cyno 
                to one-shot opposing characters, particularly with <strong>Tada!</strong> and 
                <strong>Overcharged Ball</strong>s in hand, so a copy should be kept if it appears in the starting hand. 
                <strong>The White Glove and the Fisherman</strong>, despite not costing dice, act as free +1 damage bonuses that are 
                incredible for allowing Cyno to hit damage breakpoints, but need to be shuffled into the deck early 
                for maximum efficiency.
            </p>
            <h2>Starting the Game</h2>
            <p>
                As mentioned previously, Cyno needs Pyro on opposing characters and several cards in hand to one-shot opponents, 
                so the starting character will always be Dehya, using Molten Inferno. Her personal damage is low, 
                and her Elemental Burst is expensive, so having her soak damage is ideal rather than aiming to make use 
                of her Fiery Sanctum Field's damage reduction on Round 1. Very few decks have the resources to KO Dehya 
                on Round 1, and those that do will have much less resources to stave off Cyno when he swaps in.<br><br>

                After using Dehya's Elemental Skill, the player will have 5 dice left to use on Round 1. These should be 
                used on cards to gain resources; some combination of Liben, Prospector's Drill, Gambler's Earrings, 
                Strategize, Nature and Wisdom, and Countdown to the Show: 3 can be used. The player may consider 
                using Elemental Resonance: Woven Flames to reach a sixth dice, allowing for a combination of Liben + 
                Countdown to the Show: 3, though this may leave them with less options to float dice on later Rounds 
                in order to maintain turn priority.<br><br>

                Against decks with a way to negate Pyro auras, such as decks with character cards like Sangonomiya Kokomi, 
                Barbara, and Xingqiu, Chevreuse is often the next character swapped to in order to circumvent this 
                (which can be done on Round 1). Her Elemental Burst, Ring of Bursting Grenades, deals Pyro damage to 
                the opponent's next active character after they perform a switch, all but guaranteeing Pyro auras for 
                Cyno to Overload with. However, her Elemental Skill is weak, and she lacks an efficient way to charge 
                a second point of Energy, so she often relies on Calx's Arts in order to use her Elemental Burst.</p>
            
            <h2>Follow-Up</h2>
            <p>
                In Round 2, Cyno will look for an opportunity to switch in and force an Overloaded reaction to trigger 
                Chevreuse's Vertical Force Coordination, generating an Overloaded Ball. This first attack will not 
                one-shot opponents, but can put them at a low enough HP threshold for Cyno to KO them with a single 
                attack later, and is mandatory to enable Cyno's big hits. Overloaded Ball works best when it is 
                Discarded, as it lets the player deal Pyro damage without having to commit to an attack of their own, 
                which can be done with the effect of Prospector's Drill and Tada!. This Pyro application can also 
                break the damage reduction of efficient defense like Lotus Flower Crisp, and enable use of 
                Elemental Resonance: Fervent Flames.<br><br>

                After swapping to Cyno and using an attack, the player will have 4 dice leftover (6 if Liben was triggered from Round 1). 
                Swapping to another character, usually Chevreuse, is the go-to option, as she can take advantage of Fiery Sanctum Field's 
                damage reduction if it has not been triggered that Round and use Calx's Arts to immediately attack with 
                Ring of Bursting Grenades if she has not done so already. Cyno can also opt for a second Elemental Skill, 
                which is especially powerful with Featherfall Judgment in hand. His Talent card will let him deal 5 damage, 
                have 4 Indwelling levels (i.e. a +2 damage bonus on all of his attacks) at the start of Round 3, and apply 
                Electro again for a potential second Overcharged Ball, and then swap to another character.
            </p>
            <h2>Late Game</h2>
            <p>
                At this point in the game, the player should have several, if not all of the pieces required in order for Cyno 
                to KO opponents from full health. There are a number of ways for Cyno to do this, though all require an 
                Overloaded Reaction to occur; after Elemental Resonance: Fervent Flames' +3 damage bonus, Cyno can make up the 
                last 2 points of damage with Featherfall Judgment, Prospector's Drill + another +1 damage bonus, 
                Called in for Cleanup, or 4+ levels of Indwelling. <br><br>
                
                To supplement these are Overcharged Ball and Tada! to apply 
                Pyro before Cyno attacks without giving the opponent a chance to respond with an attack of their own, 
                Gambler's Earrings in order to gain dice back after a KO, 
                Leave It to Me! to allow Cyno to attack after a swap immediately, 
                Fresh Wind of Freedom to maintain momentum and potentially force back-to-back KOs, 
                and Countdown to the Show (ideally at a cost of 2 or less) or Nature and Wisdom to allow the player to search 
                for any of the above cards. After two uses of his Elemental Skill, Cyno will have 4 Indwelling levels by Round 3, 
                giving him a free +2 damage bonus on all his attacks. This allows him to finish off the game reliably 
                without the need for Elemental Auras.<br><br>

                The player should be aiming to chain the effects of Gambler's Earrings this Round with the use of the above cards, 
                and saving remaining resources for taking out the opponent's final character. 
                Lotus Flower Crisp can be used liberally here, as the deck's gameplan crumbles without Cyno on standby.
            </p>
            <h2>Protecting Cyno</h2>
            <p>
                The deck's main defense against opposing attacks, besides using the health points of other characters 
                to take damage for Cyno, are Fiery Sanctum Field's damage reduction, Prospector Drill's damage reduction, 
                and Lotus Flower Crisp. An important nuance to note is that both Prospector Drill's damage reduction and 
                Lotus Flower Crisp's damage reduction are both Character Statuses, meaning the order in which they are 
                depleted depends entirely on which effect comes into play first. If both effects are needed to defend Cyno, 
                it is best to play Prospector's Drill first so that 1 damage instances like opposing Overcharged Balls 
                or effects like Kuki Shinobu's Grass Ring of Sanctification and Tada! do not 'waste' the extra damage 
                reduction from Lotus Flower Crisp. This is especially important in the mirror match, as the deck has 
                very low damage output outside of Cyno, meaning whichever side lets their Cyno be KOed first is 
                almost always the loser.
            </p>
            <h2>Managing Prospector Drill's Discards</h2>
            <p>Prospector's Drill's damage reduction comes at the price of the highest cost Card being Discarded 
                upon the holder taking damage. Ideally, the card being Discarded in this way is Overcharged Ball 
                (barring scenarios where you may want to retain the threat of immediate Pyro application). 
                The deck is built around allowing Prospector's Drill to target and Discard Overcharged Balls 
                as much as possible, though there are more expensive cards than it in the deck for good reason. 
                These are Featherfall Judgment, which provides a +2 damage bonus for an extremely easy to meet prerequisite, 
                Countdown to the Show: 3, which effectively has its cost reduced upon being Discarded, 
                and Prospector's Drill itself (the second copy is very rarely used). <br><br>
                
                Due to how efficient Featherfall Judgment is for Cyno's damage output, it may be required that the player 
                telegraph it and equip it early so that Prospector's Drill does not accidentally Discard it. 
                Nature and Wisdom can be also used to shuffle these higher cost Cards back into the deck, 
                though the player will save more dice by Tuning them in order to get Prospector's Drill to 
                Discard the 'right' card (Overcharged Ball).<br><br>

                Tada! can trigger Prospector Drill's Discard effect without opponent intervention, and its 
                confirmation screen can allow the player to see whether or not Overcharged Ball will be Discarded 
                (it will show the opponent taking 1 Pyro damage if this is the case). This is also the case if there 
                is an effect like Sparks n' Splash or Thunderbore Trap on Cyno's side, appearing on the confirmation 
                screen before Cyno uses a skill. Note that drawing into other 2 cost cards with effects like 
                Strategize can cause Prospector's Drill's effect to choose a different card to Discard.
