            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Keqing Whale, or KeqWhale, is a midrange deck that aims to build up All-Devouring Narwhal's HP to high levels, 
                eventually overwhelming the opponent. First use Layla's Nights of Formal Focus to gain value over time with 
                Shooting Star while drawing as many cards as possible. Then use Keqing's Stellar Restoration to generate 
                Lightning Stilettos and Tune cards aggressively to increase Deep Devourer's Domain. Once Keqing falls, 
                finish them off with the All-Devouring Narwhal!
            </p>
            <h2>Mulligan</h2>
            <p>KeqWhale wants to have high amounts of cards in hand throughout the game so that Deep Devourer's Domain can be 
                built up quickly. Liyue Harbor Wharf and Serene are particularly good to have on Round 1 as there is a delay to 
                their ability to add cards to Hand. Timaeus has a similar delay in his cost 
                reduction applied to equipping Artifacts; this allows for Marachaussee Hunter to be equipped for free on 
                All-Devouring Narwhal as early as Round 2 to take advantage of the All-Devouring Narwhal's healing. 
                Dunyarzad, Seed Dispensary, Strategize, and Countdown to the Show: 3 can supplement the above.<br><br>

                The Legend of Vennessa can be kept in hand if an extra die is needed to play cards or attack, 
                though this often requires Countdown to the Show: 3 available as well to offset the random Elemental Dice created. 
                If several of the above key cards have already appeared in the starting hand to enable a very favourable 
                Round 1 opener, Central Laboratory Ruins, Marechaussee Hunter, or Veteran's Visage can be kept if 
                they appear so that they are available on Round 2, which is when the bulk of the deck's Tuning begins.<br><br>
                
                Lastly, against decks that are reliant on an early Elemental Burst to threaten All-Devouring Narwhal 
                before it can gain enough resources (such as certain combo decks), Vicious Ancient Battle should be 
                kept in hand to slow them down by reducing the enabling unit's Energy. 

            </p>
            <h2>Early Game</h2>
            <p>
                Since the deck wants to have as many cards in hand as early as possible, and thus needs to spend a fair amount 
                of dice on accelerating the deck's card draw, Layla is almost always the go-to starting character. 
                She is meant to soak early game damage while the player sets up, and should use 
                Nights of Formal Focus as the situation calls for.<br><br>

                The created Shooting Star's speed is based solely on the pace at which the player performs Skills, 
                so this effect doesn't need to be set up too early unless the opposing deck's damage output 
                is high enough to threaten Layla before she can act on Round 2. A typical Round 1 opener consists of Layla 
                using Nights of Formal Focus with the other 5 dice on card draw, or forgoing the Elemental Skill to allow the player to 
                spend all 8 dice on card draw. The player should prioritize Liyue Harbor Wharf and Serene if 
                they are available, and fit in Dunyarzad, Seed Dispensary, Timaeus, Strategize, and Countdown to the Show: 3 
                as appropriate (avoid overdrawing as much as possible). Marachaussee Hunter or Veteran's Visage can be 
                equipped on All-Devouring Narwhal if there is no better way to use dice.<br><br>
                
                If Nights of Formal Focus has already been used and there is no other way to spend a die, 
                the player can swap to Keqing early. Note that this may put her in danger of early Skills 
                from the opponent, so consider leaving the die unused instead to protect her.
                
            </p>
            
            <h2>Mid-Game</h2>
            <p>
                Round 2 is where Deep Devourer's Domain begins to accumulate quickly, as the player should have nearly if not 
                a full hand of cards to Tune for its effect. Round 2 should be spent attacking with Keqing's Elemental Skill, 
                using the remaining dice on more card draw. Consider rerolling Omni or Electro dice at the start 
                of Round 2 so that as many cards as possible can be devoured by the All-Devouring Narwhal. The player can also 
                Tune cards while Layla is the active character to overwrite Electro Dice and 
                allow for more Tuning opportunities when Keqing swaps in. Tuning and then using The Legend of Vennessa 
                to turn Aligned dice back into Unaligned dice is also an option.<br><br>

                Deep Devourer's Domain increases All-Devouring Narwhal's Max HP by 1 for every 3 cards the player Tuned or Discarded 
                (this deck mainly Tunes cards to meet this prerequisite), and increases its Max HP 
                by another point for every card within the trio that matches the cost of some other card within the trio. 
                This means that if a 1 cost card has been Tuned, the next 2 cards Tuned (or Discarded) should ideally also 
                be 1 cost cards to maximize the Max HP gained by All-Devouring Narwhal. Generally, the player should try to
                avoid Tuning in a way that results in suboptimal Max HP gain.<br><br>
                
                Central Laboratory Ruins should typically be played as early as possible during the Round so that the Tuning 
                also counts for Central Laboratory Ruins's dice generation. 
                Veteran's Visage or Marachaussee Hunter should be equipped on All-Devouring Narwhal, at the latest, right 
                before it gains HP (i.e. before Tuning the third card) to trigger their effects.<br><br>
                
                The Lightning Stilettos generated by Keqing should almost always be Tuned. This allows each use of 
                Stellar Restoration to generate another Lightning Stiletto, creating more cards to be Tuned.
                If the player needs to attack with Keqing again when Tuning a Lightning Stiletto in hand is not possible, 
                they should note that using Stellar Restoration while a Lightning Stiletto card is in hand will 
                cause Lightning Stiletto to be Discarded, making it still count towards Deep Devourer's Domain. 
                Playing the Lightning Stiletto from the hand has the same effect, but without considering the Lightning Stiletto 
                as Discarded. The player should consider what cards have been Tuned previously or are going to be Tuned 
                so that Keqing's attacks do not interfere with the "groups of 3".
            </p>
            <h2>Late Game</h2>
            <p>
                By Round 3, All-Devouring Narwhal's HP should be in the double digits thanks to the player's Tuning. 
                This is usually the point in the game when Keqing falls, prompting a character swap, and typically this is 
                All-Devouring Narwhal to take advantage of its high HP and damage output by repeatedly using its Elemental Skill 
                and Elemental Burst.<br><br>

                The timing of triggering Deep Devourer's Domain matters more now. The damage dealt by 
                All-Devouring Narwhal's Elemental Skill increases by 1 point for every 3 HP gained from Insatiable Appetite 
                (the max HP increases from Deep Devourer's Domain), up to a maximum of 5 DMG at 12 stacks. All-Devouring Narwhal will also be taking the brunt of attacks 
                as the main active character. Moreover, the Dark Shadow summoned by All-Devouring Narwhal's Elemental Burst 
                inherits Usages equal to the amount of cards of the highest cost Tuned or Discarded by the player at the time 
                it is summoned. All these things incentivize the player to Tune as soon as possible rather 
                than later on. The player should consider if there is a need to equip Ocean-Hued Clam at this point as well, 
                as its conditional DMG bonus can be met with the max HP increase from Deep Devourer's Domain.<br><br>
                
                Using All-Devouring Narwhal's Elemental Skill will Discard the highest cost card in the player's Hand, 
                which will affect Deep Devourer's Domain and is useful to contribute to it even if the player cannot Tune. 
                However, if the player does not have many Aligned dice, they should consider Tuning cards before All-Devouring Narwhal 
                attacks (even if it does not result in its Elemental Skill gaining damage) to ensure it can use its strong Elemental 
                Skill and Elemental Burst.<br><br>
                
                The Dark Shadow summoned by All-Devouring Narwhal's Elemental Burst should be dealing 3 Electro DMG per hit 
                (if Lightning Stiletto is tuned at all, this is guaranteed). It also repeats the damage and consumes a Usage 
                when the player declares the End of their Round.
                This is important to keep in mind when considering its DMG Reduction effect as 2 Usages are consumed 
                when the active character takes DMG, and it will disappear immediately upon hitting 0 Usages. This can result 
                in the Summon no longer being active to deal damage in the End Phase.<br><br>
                
                If Keqing was able to get off several attacks, Shooting Star will also get close to triggering for 
                the second time, which can enable All-Devouring Narwhal to disrupt the opponent with Frozen. 
                Layla, if she has not fallen, can be switched to as needed, even directly after Keqing falls. 
                A second Elemental Skill from her can accumulate Shooting Star faster and provide Shields to force the 
                opponent to spend more dice to try and take her out, and her Elemental Burst is decently strong while 
                providing reliable Cryo application for All-Devouring Narwhal 
                to apply Frozen or even Superconduct with Dark Shadow.                                
            </p>
            <h2>Choosing what to Tune</h2>
            <p>
                As mentioned previously, the Dark Shadow summoned by All-Devouring Narwhal's Elemental Burst inherits Usages 
                equal to the amount of cards of the highest cost Tuned or Discarded by the player at the time it is summoned, 
                and inherits the damage equal to that cost. This is most definitely 3, if the player Tunes any Lightning Stilettos, 
                but maximizing the amount of Usages of the Dark Shadow is valuable due 
                to its high damage and damage reduction.<br><br>

                The second copy of Ocean-Hued Clam, Veteran's Visage, Marechaussee Hunter, and Countdown to the Show: 3 
                are very rarely, if ever used, so they can be Tuned without remorse. Liyue Harbor Wharf's delay makes it much 
                less valuable in the late game, so it can be Tuned then as well. If other Companions have already been played, 
                Dunyarzad drops in value as it loses the potential to discount cards, meaning it can afford to be Tuned. 
                Paimon is difficult to play without Seed Dispensary or Dunyarzad from a previous Round to discount it and 
                also has a delay on its value, so it can afford to be Tuned as well. Veteran's Visage has a very similar 
                effect to Marechaussee Hunter and is only practically equipped on All-Devouring Narwhal, so once 1 of these 2 
                Artifacts have been equipped, the other copies can safely be Tuned. Even immediate card draw like Strategize 
                can be Tuned if it is not needed in the late game.<br><br>

                Sunyata Flower's discount is usually more valuable than Tuning it, especially since there are not many other 
                0 cost cards in the deck that would like to be Tuned. "I'd Rather Lose Money Myselfâ€¦" is valuable against combo 
                decks and other All-Devouring Narwhal decks to take advantage of their own dice generation 
                (it is particularly good against The Legend of Vennessa), so it should not be Tuned unless the opponent 
                no longer has the ability to generate many dice.<br><br>
                
                Lastly, Tada! should never be Tuned if the opponent has a way to afflict All-Devouring Narwhal with Frozen.
                Furthermore, if the opponent can apply Frozen to All-Devouring Narwhal, the player should keep some higher
                cost cards in hand so that the All-Devouring Narwhal does not accidentally discard the 0-cost Tada! due to
                the effects of its Elemental Skill.
            </p>
            <h2>Maximizing Melusine Supports</h2>
            <p>
                The Melusine Supports (cards of this type are colloquially referred to as Tokens) generated by Serene can be 
                Tuned or played, depending on what is in the player's hand. Generally, Puca and Virda can be Tuned freely; 
                Puca's Companion generation is too erratic to give more value than the player's own Support Cards, and may 
                even benefit the opponent by providing Companions to them, and Virda's dice cost of 2 to generate 2 more cards 
                is usually not worth the price. However, Puca can provide a free target for Sunyata Flower, which can make 
                it worth playing if the opponent's Support Zone is full or close to full and if the player has a valuable 
                Support card to play, like Central Laboratory Ruins.<br><br>

                Cosanzeana, Laume, Serene (not to be confused with the Companion card called Serene; This refers to Serene's Support) 
                are all 0 cost cards that generate 2 random cards of a specific type and place them into the player's hand. 
                These are Weapons, Artifacts, and Food cards respectively. They can be Tuned to finish a trio of cards for 
                Deep Devourer's Domain, but their cost of 0 means they can also easily be played to generate an extra card. 
                Paying attention to the type of card generated will help the player Tune in sets of 3; for example, 
                since Cosanzeana only ever generates Weapons, it will never generate a card with a cost besides 2 or 3.<br><br>

                Canotila has a similar effect to the above Tokens, but has a cost of 1. The set of cards it generates from are 
                "resonances", being the Action Cards that can only be placed in the deck if two or more of the the Character Cards 
                share Elements or regions. These are generally more useful than the random Weapons or Artifacts created 
                by Cosanzeana and Laume, and the Elemental Resonances in particular give good value for the dice spent 
                (barring Fervent Flames and Enduring Rock, which have no way to be triggered by this deck). Thirona also has an 
                effect similar to Canotila for a cost of 0 but with the tradeoff of a delayed generation. These are generally worth 
                playing more than Tuning if the player can afford to wait or spend dice on them.<br><br>

                Sluasi has a cost of 1, like Canotila, but rather than generating entirely random cards from a set, 
                it copies 3 cards from the top of the opponent's deck. This means that Sluasi often grants the player 
                more useful cards than the other Tokens, as most opponents aiming to win will use Action Cards that 
                are good in their decks. Having 2 copies of Sluasi guarantees that the player will have at least 3 sets 
                of 2 cards with the same cost, making it very easy to finish a set of 3 cards for Deep Devourer's Domain. 
                Even if the cards copied are useless, having 3 cards immediately that can be Tuned for 1 die is equivalent 
                to a Lotus Flower Crisp for All-Devouring Narwhal, but is more valuable in the form of pure HP rather 
                than a Barrier. Sluasi should almost always be played rather than Tuned.<br><br>

                Lutine and Topyas are the two most interesting and arguably most impactful Melusine Supports. 
                Both cost 0 dice and draw the player 2 cards immediately a la Strategize and creates a 50/50 effect 
                for both players. Lutine's effect randomly heals or damages an active character for 2 HP or 2 Piercing 
                Damage after they use a Skill, up to twice. This can result in very large damage swings, potentially 
                being very helpful or harmful to a particular player. Ideally, the player can play Lutine if the card draw 
                is beneficial enough and if they would not be harmed too much by only taking Piercing damage and only healing 
                the opponent.<br><br>

                Topyas' effect has no Usage limit and lasts for the entire Round. Upon playing a card, 
                the player can draw an extra card from the deck or have a random card in their Hand Discarded. 
                For this deck which centers around Discarding and Tuning cards, this effect can be considered a 'win-win', 
                though care must be taken to make the most of it. Since there are cards that want to be played more than they 
                want to be Discarded, like Central Laboratory Ruins and The Legend of Vennessa, the player may consider 
                playing all these cards prior to playing Topyas. However, playing too many can leave the player 
                with no way to trigger its effect if Topyas continually Discards cards from the player's Hand. 
                Topyas also counts its own play for its 50/50 effect, meaning it can draw an extra card immediately or 
                Discard a card immediately.<br><br>

                Since Topyas' Discard effect is completely random, it may also interfere with the groups of 3 ideal 
                for Deep Devourer's Domain. The best way to handle this is by having a "blank slate" for Deep Devourer's Domain 
                prior to triggering Topyas; that is, having 0 out of 3 cards Tuned or Discarded beforehand. This allows the player 
                to react and Tune properly upon seeing Topyas Discard something; if it Discards a 1 cost card, the player can 
                Tune two 1 cost cards to maximize All-Devouring Narwhal's HP increase before playing another card. However, 
                this is not always feasible to set up before playing Topyas. It may also be acceptable to simply allow Topyas 
                to Discard randomly if the player has many ways to trigger its effect for free (by playing other Melusine Tokens, 
                or Sunyata Flower), as the All-Devouring Narwhal will still gain respectable HP if only 2 cards out of a group of 
                3 cards Tuned or Discarded share a cost.<br><br>

                To summarize:<br>
                Puca, Virda: Tune<br>
                Cosanzeana, Laume, Serene, Canotila, Thirona: Play, but you can Tune<br>
                Sluasi: Play<br>
                Lutine: Play (highrollers only)<br>
                Topyas: Play<br>
            </p>
            <h2>Alternative Card Choices</h2>
            <h3>Character Cards</h3>
            <p>All-Devouring Narwhal is irreplaceable as the entire deck's strategy centers around its Deep Devourer's Domain 
                mechanic, but the other Character Cards are somewhat interchangeable. <br><br>

                Instead of Keqing, the player could choose to run Consecrated Scorpion, who creates Bonecruncher's Energy Blocks 
                after using its Elemental Skill and shuffles them into the top of the deck. Its Elemental Burst is cheaper, 
                and can deal high damage with several Bonecruncher's Energy Blocks to increase Thunderbore Trap. Bonecruncher's 
                Energy Blocks are also Discarded upon using the Consecrated Scorpion's Elemental Burst, which can feed 
                Deep Devourer's Domain. Lastly, the card created by Consecrated Scorpion can be more versatile on play than Keqing's, 
                as Bonecruncher's Energy Blocks create free Aligned dice on play.<br><br>
                
                However, Consecrated Scorpion's Bonecruncher's Energy Blocks are a 0 cost card rather than a 3 cost card, 
                making 'charging' Dark Shadow more difficult via Tuning, especially when considering Tuning them means 
                they cannot be played to gain Aligned dice. The fact that Consecrated Scorpion shuffles 
                Bonecruncher's Energy Blocks into the deck at the end of each Round, and places them at the top of the deck 
                after using an Elemental Skill, can cause the deck to become 'bloated', making it harder to draw into key cards early.<br><br>
                
                Consecrated Scorpion's Talent Card can remedy this, but requires Action Card space and is also a cheap 1 cost card 
                rather than an expensive 3 cost card. Its Elemental Burst Discarding Bonecruncher's Energy Blocks can be awkward 
                if the player has partially Tuned or Discard a set of 3 cards, as it may decrease the potential HP gain from 
                Deep Devourer's Domain. Keqing is also not a high demand character for other meta decks, making replacing her more 
                of a matter of personal preference.<br><br>
                
                Layla can be substituted for Cryo Hypostasis. Cryo Hypostasis deals higher early game damage, applies Cryo immediately 
                with its skills, and charges its Elemental Burst more easily thanks to Overwhelming Ice giving it a reason to Normal Attack. 
                Combined with Keqing's Electro application, the duo can deal significant Piercing damage early, and gives the player a 
                reason to use Lightning Stiletto rather than Tune it. The unique targeting of the Piercing Iceridge summoned by its 
                Elemental Burst can force Cryo auras onto off-field characters, which is useful for allowing All-Devouring Narwhal 
                to attack freely. Lastly, its revival mechanic can make it a nuisance to KO efficiently.<br><br>
                
                However, Cryo Hypostasis suffers from somewhat low personal damage late game, with most of its damage output 
                coming from off-field Piercing damage. It is also more obligated to perform skills to get value as opposed 
                to Layla's "set it and forget it" Shooting Star. Cryo Hypostasis incentivizes the player to start with Keqing 
                rather than itself, as Keqing wants to be able to attack and make use of early Cryo auras with Lightning Stiletto. 
                This can be problematic, as it often necessitates a skill from Keqing on Round 1 into a character swap (to protect her), 
                which leaves the player with less dice to spend on card draw and demands more Aligned dice as opposed to a 'float 8' Round 1 
                from Layla. Using Lightning Stilettos also prevents them from contributing to Deep Devourer's Domain, which can 
                make increasing All-Devouring Narwhal's HP and increasing Dark Shadow's Usages more difficult.
            </p>
            <h3>Action Cards</h3>
            <p>
                Sacrificial Sword boosts Keqing's personal damage considerably, making matchups into slower decks 
                with no way to pressure Keqing better, and can make back its 3 dice cost with its effect. 
                It gives an edge in the mirror matchup, as it allows 3 Stellar Restorations from Keqing to 3HKO opposing 
                10 HP characters, even through Layla's Shields. When drawn late, it is effective fodder for Dark Shadow 
                and Deep Devourer's Domain. However, Keqing needs to survive long enough to use a skill on Round 3 
                for it to give value greater than a 2 cost weapon (assuming it is drawn by Round 1 or Round 2), 
                and it can be argued that the deck already matches favourably into slower decks due to them having 
                no way to answer All-Devouring Narwhal, particularly Dark Shadow's high End Phase damage. <br><br>

                Lightless Feeding, All-Devouring Narwhal's Talent Card, heals it for HP equal to the card Discarded 
                by its Elemental Skill once per Round, which improves its longevity considerably. However, it costs 4 Aligned dice, 
                which makes using its Elemental Skill more costly the first time, but more importantly is disastrous 
                for Dark Shadow as Tuning or Discarding it accidentally will cause it to deal 4 damage instead and 
                have a very low number of Usages. Keeping the Talent in hand and using All-Devouring Narwhal's Elemental Skill instead 
                (to try and preserve the healing for when it first takes damage, for instance) is not an option due to its 
                Elemental Skill Discard targeting the highest cost card in the player's Hand, which will always be Lightless Feeding.<br><br>

                Sir Arthur is also an alternative for obtaining more cards to Tune. If the player have Tuned or Discarded 2 cards that Round,
                Sir Arthur will add a copy of the top card of the opponent's Deck to the Hand. This can be helpful in obtaining information
                about the opponent's Hand as well as possibly drawing cards that are able to be played. Note that a similar pitfall exists
                with Sir Arthur as does Lightless Feeding: If the opponent plays cards that are 4 cost or higher, they cannot be Tuned
                without crippling the Dark Shadow, and All-Devouring Narwhal will find it hard to match groups of 3 with that card.
                Therefore, this card seldom sees play when faced against a Bennett deck, which most definitely contains his Talent Card.

                The number of copies of Paimon, Timaeus, and Seed Dispensary could be adjusted to the user's preference.
